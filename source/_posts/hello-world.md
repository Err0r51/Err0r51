If you are reading this post, then I procrastinated successfully and started a blog instead of focusing on my master thesis. It also means that my CI/CD pipeline is working and I am able to deploy it.... I hope. Stay tuned for more content.
Till then: happy coding
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
