## Who am I?
No. Fucking. Clue. <br>
Jokes aside, I am somewhat of a software engineer in training, finishing my masters degree at [TU Munich](https://www.tum.de/). My main focus areas currently are data engineering (primarly in Python) and fullstack development (primarly in TypeScript), so this blog will mainly contain posts about those topics. On the other side I am also interested in DevOps and cloud-native architectures, so you might find some post about me struggling there as well...     

## Motivation
Honestly I always thought having a blog is kind of narcissistic. As someone who doesn't have a traditional CS background my default thought was always: I am the only one, who is stupid enough to not know this!
But eventually realized that some people might struggle with the same stuff as I am. So I decided to share my journey and the stuff I learn along the way. 

## Contact
I am not really designing this blog to be a two-way conversation, so I will not enable any discussion features or disclose PII here. If you want to discuss something I wrote, feel free to open an issue on the respective GitHub repository. If you need to reach out to me personally, you can do so via: err0r53 'at' protonmail.com but don't expect a quick response there.
